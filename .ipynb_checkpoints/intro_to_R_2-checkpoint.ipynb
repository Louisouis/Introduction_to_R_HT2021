    "## 2. Control statements in R\n",
    "In the previous part we have seen how to manipulate variables and store data or meta-data in them. However, the point in having data stored in variables is to do something with them and this can be achieved in a number of ways. R has a rich collection of function packages (curated on [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org)) offering functions that perform specific tasks (e.g. the ```boot``` package contains functions allowing easy bootstrapping methods, ```ggplot2``` is used for data plotting, ```dplyr``` allows for fast data manipulation, ```mada``` provides help with meta-analyses). However, when a function is not already available, we can use classical programming approaches to write it. Variables and data storage is one part of such a strategy. Using control statements is another. \n",
    "\n",
    "One such control statement is the conditional statement ```if (...) {} else {}```. The statement in the round brackets has to be a logical expression. If that expression evaluates to TRUE, the statements in the first set of curly brackets are executed. If the conditional expression evaluates to FALSE, the statements in the second pair of curly brackets are executed. Note that an ```else``` branch is not mandatory."

    "Looping statements are designed to perform the same task multiple times depending on some criterion. R offers the ```while```, and ```for``` loops for this purpose. ```while``` loops are testing a logical expression before executing the task that needs to be repeated and are typically used in cases where the number of necessary repetitions is not known in advance (e.g. the Euclidean algorithm to determine the greatest common divisor). When the number of repetitions is known in advance (e.g. data stored in an array has to be plotted and the size of the array is known), a ```for``` loop is used. Two examples below demonstrate the difference between the two looping structures."
